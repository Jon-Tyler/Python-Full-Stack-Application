# Python-Full-Stack Application

Over the duration of the associates degree college education. Students were tasked with creating a program for the final assignment of many programming courses. At the time I completed this assignment for a fundamentals in programming course, it was a standalone program. As I grew conceptually and with programmatical skills. I decided to add other elements to the program. 

What you will see is the python code for the program of the final assignment. Any future commits will either re-structure the design pattern of the program or contribute to the overall program. 


Next Stages of the Program
---------------------------
1. ADD a MySQL Database as the backend of the program. 
2. ADD either an Angular.js or REACT.js Front End to communicate with the REST API.
