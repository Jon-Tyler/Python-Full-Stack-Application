   This project is introducing the aspect of GitHub to me in Computer Programming, Software Development, Application Development. Over the coming months and years some of the projects that I undertake will be posted to GitHub as a way of showcasing some of my abilities as a software developer. Also, without showing absolutely everyone and every block of code. 

I hope you enjoy, if you have any questions. Please, feel free to message me as I would like to hear from anyone in the community regarding any suitable topic.


Sincerely,

     Jon-Tyler
